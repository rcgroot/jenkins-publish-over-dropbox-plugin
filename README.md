# Publish over Dropbox plugin for Jenkins

Based on publish-to-ftp and extending publish-to and basic-credentials this Jenkins plugin publishes artifacts in a post-build to dropbox folders without the need to run a sync client on your build server.

# Installation

There are 3 options:

1. Install the plugin through the Jenkins plugin manager. (Version 1.0.5 is available at this time)
2. ~~Install a beta~~
3. Compile your own
  1. Create an own Dropbox app in the on https://developer.dropbox.com/
  2. Clone the sources and update the Config.java with your personal client id and client secret.
  3. Run the "mvn hpi:hpi" on the project source code
  4. Install the generated publish-over-dropbox.hpi on the advanced section of the plugin manager of your Jenkins installation.
